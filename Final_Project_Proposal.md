### Framing the Project
o	Over the past decade, we have seen a rise in the popularity in coding and programming. More people strive to become coding gurus and enter the field of technology and software engineering. With this rise in the interest in code, there has also been an increase in the social media accounts teaching others how to code and tips and tricks for programming. Overall, Iâ€™d like to analyze the rise in these profiles and compare them to the growth of women in the field of software engineering and data science. 
o	As someone who was incredibly set on become a doctor and vowed the complete pre-med in undergrad, a hackathon my freshman year changed everything. It opened my eyes to the possibilities we have when presented with code, and how to learn these odd letter and number combinations that looked like a foreign language. I have experience in Java, Python, and little HTML, and I would love to continue to learn more. 
o	I do not have any outside resources that I can base this project off of.
o	The social media site I want to utilize for this project is Twitter, and using their APIs to develop a 
o	Cite and discuss any relevant course readings or outside sources that have shaped how you are thinking about this topic
### Proposed Methodology
o	I will be utilizing Twitter APIs and web scraping for the completion of this project and then importing all of this into a Python script to then use Pandas to categorize and develop data sets for different accounts, likes, followers, etc. 
o	I hope to create a website that combines all the programming ideas given throughout Twitter accounts and combine my research on the topic there as a display of my work. 
o	I believe that I will need to utilize the above methods to find the data that I need off of Twitter (or other social media sites that I may end up using). 
### Detailed Work Plan
o	Create a base in WordPress of a basic website so I have a baseline for where to put my data. 
o	Begin web scraping Twitter or analyzing existing APIs that may be used in the process. 
o	Utilize scripts and Python (pandas) to help with the breakdown and combination of data frames. 
o	Identify ways to develop and place interactive graphs/pictures like the Pudding articles using my data.
