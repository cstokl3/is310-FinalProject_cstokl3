## What DH Tools Are Actually Used in Research?

The week we discussed this article was the very week I decided exactly where my final project would go. It deemed the stepping stone for the analysis I did on hot programming languages and how change has occured over time. But other than my personal ties to this week, it is also important to mention that I was also blown away by the visuals created and the ability for a few lines of code to develop the graphs and easy to read analysis presented in this blog post. It was also intersting to see the multitude of tools I have never seen before, be used so frequently by people in so many branches of research and niches. 

Overall, I would say that the easy analysis of the graphs and presentation of the blog post made me want to develop something similar of my own. In that same sentiment, it was also intriguing to see what the different ways of development are over the years and how things like social media, in this case Twitter, can be used as something other than a social media site. A data gold mine can be found in so many different places on the internet, and it can really aid in the development of human/societal research, especially in the digital humanities!
