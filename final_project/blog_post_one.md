## Haunted By Data

The week where we had spoken about the importance and nuances of data organization, gathering, organization, cleaning and etc. I was really about to understand more about what it means to even be a "data lake" as Ceglowski really emphasized in this weeks topic of discussion and the reading. This was territory I had never been in, and as sometone completly new to even the term "data lake" it seemed unnerving that we would consider something like data, a lake if it was in large quantities. To add even further on that, the toxic waste that we consider to be things like nuclear waste were also something we should not have called data. 

And this was where my thoughts had changed. When things like heart rate data collected by large watch manufactures, or any of our other personal health data were being tracker, or our website history, etc. Everything we touch has become its own data lake with the rapid expansion of data everywhere. From the 7 billion people we have been tracking for so long, to the clear that things like the GitHub arctic repository, which was mentioned in this week have become an interesting example of what happens to our data.
